## üõ†Ô∏è System Design Overview
The system follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend (React + Vite + Zustand + React Query):** Handles UI, routing, state management, and API integration.  
- **Backend (Express + MongoDB):** Manages authentication, chat APIs, AI services, and database operations.  
- **Socket.IO:** Enables real-time messaging and voice interactions.  
- **AI Integrations:** OpenAI, Google Generative AI, HuggingFace, Cohere.  
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ORM.  

---

## üéØ Use Cases
- User signs up, completes onboarding, and starts using chat.  
- User initiates real-time chat with another user.  
- User joins a video call session via Stream SDK.  
- User interacts with AI Tutor for voice/text learning.  
- User generates SEO content and optimized prompts.  
- User translates text or converts text to image.  

---

## üìÖ Project Roadmap
- Phase 1: Setup project environment, configure frontend + backend, connect MongoDB.  
- Phase 2: Implement authentication, onboarding, and protected routes.  
- Phase 3: Develop real-time chat and notifications module with Socket.IO.  
- Phase 4: Integrate video calling using Stream SDK.  
- Phase 5: Add AI modules (AI Tutor, Text-to-Prompt, Text-to-Image, SEO Tools).  
- Phase 6: Implement voice-based AI interaction with Socket.IO and Gemini/OpenAI.  
- Phase 7: Optimize performance, add testing (Jest + Supertest), and improve security.  
- Phase 8: Deployment on cloud (Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Render/Heroku/AWS for backend).
